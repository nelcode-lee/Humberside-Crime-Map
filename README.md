Humberside Police - Reported Crimes 2023

Tech - Jupyter Lab:
Plotly
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn


Scope: I wanted to test my skills and set about sourcing the data for the local Police (Humberside).

Project - Map reported crime using a combination of scatterplot and plotly.express mapbox.
Satter by crime type and allow data filter by crime.

Findings - This was a really useful project that in the real world would assist with:
Targeting criminal behaviour hotspots
Resource planning
Understanding the role that the public plays in fighting crime
Liaising with the public on crime stats
